The pickadilly man had hands on his feet
 

When he played the old piano

The notes would fly up to the ceiling

Into the tune of the whip-poor-will

And they'd rattle around the rafters

And they'd fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will

And it's rattle around the rafters

And it's fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will
The pickadilly man had hands on his feet
When he played the old piano

The notes would fly up to the eaves
Into the tune of the whip-poor-will
And they'd rattle around the rafters
And they'd fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will
And it's rattle around the rafters
And it's fall back into a song
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The pickadilly man had hands on his feet
When he played the old piano
The notes would fly up to the eaves
Into the tune of the whip-poor-will
And they'd rattle around the rafters
And they'd fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will
And it's rattle around the rafters
And it's fall back into a song
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
