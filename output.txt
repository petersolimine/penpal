The pickadilly man had hands on his feet
 

When he played the old piano

The notes would fly up to the ceiling

Into the tune of the whip-poor-will

And they'd rattle around the rafters

And they'd fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will

And it's rattle around the rafters

And it's fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will
The pickadilly man had hands on his feet
When he played the old piano

The notes would fly up to the eaves
Into the tune of the whip-poor-will
And they'd rattle around the rafters
And they'd fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will
And it's rattle around the rafters
And it's fall back into a song
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The pickadilly man had hands on his feet
When he played the old piano
The notes would fly up to the eaves
Into the tune of the whip-poor-will
And they'd rattle around the rafters
And they'd fall back into a song
The tune of the whip-poor-will
And it's rattle around the rafters
And it's fall back into a song
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will
The whip-poor-will

[Verse 1]
She had breath hot like a fire
 
	She had two eyes like a diamond

	She had a face like a baby

	She had hair hanging down

	She had shoes of Chinese silk

	She had a skirt made of gingham

	She had a big bust on her

	She had a waist you could span

	But she had a broken arm

	She took me upstairs in her house

	She showed me a bed with no mattress

	She took off her clothes

	She proves to me she’s a woman

	Then she breaks my neck
[Verse 2]

	She took me out in the kitchen

	She grabs a knife and cuts me

	She grabs a frying pan and sticks it in my belly

She throws me down on the floor

	Rolls me down the stairs

	Just before I reached the bottom

	My body broke into two
Standing by my side

	Was my greatest friend
Death that old buddy of mine
[Chorus]

	Well there’s no use starting to explain

Round every corner I’m gonna find you

Standin’ there lookin’ so plain

	You never let me down

	You always stick around

	Yes there’s no use starting to explain

	My greatest friend is death
[Verse 3]

	She stabs me in the chest with a carving knife

	Stick a fork right into my eye

	She pounds me with a skillet

	Breaks my bones till they crack

	She throws me down on the floor

	Rolls me down a flight of stairs

	Then she breaks my neck
She broke my neck
She broke my neck
I guess I’ll die
[Verse 4]

	She had breath hot like a fire

	She had two eyes like a diamond

	She had a face like a baby

	She had hair hanging down

	She had shoes of Chinese silk

	She had a skirt made of gingham

	She had a big bust on her

	She had a waist you could span

	But she had a broken arm

	Well I woke up in the morning

	I’m all aching and sore

	I see three women standin’ over me

	One’s got a churn

	One’s got a bedpan

	One’s got an armful of flowers

[Verse 1]
Angels smoking cigarrettes
 
	With their long hair tied behind their heads

	They got bad manners, they got no sense

	They’re gonna die young

	They’ve got everything but they’re still wanting more

	They’ve gotta figure out some way

	To fill the void within

	They got nothing

	They’re gonna die young
[Verse 2]

	Angels falling down to earth

	Someone’s gotta pick them up, I guess it’s up to me

	I got no choice, I guess they’re mine

	They got nothing, they’re gonna die young
[Verse 3]

	They’re smoking hand-rolled tobacco

	They stick pins in their flesh

(From an old Mexican sculptor)

They’re deep drowning in the blood of love

	They’re gonna die young

	They got nothing

	They’re gonna die young
[Verse 4]

	Angels flying high through the clouds

	With a torch in one hand and a knife in the other

	They’re crying diamonds, bleeding silver

	They’re gonna die young

[Chorus]
And the red ran like a river
 
	When you shot old Bob McCardle
You shot him in the back, Lord
And the dirty dogs fingered you
[Verse 1]
Some said the devil was born and raised in you
Others said you hung the moon
When you left old Bob breathless and dead
With the nickel-plated Colt
[Chorus]
And the red ran like a river
When you shot old Bob McCardle
You shot him in the back, Lord
And the dirty dogs fingered you

[Verse 1]
Seventeen months he ran from the law
 
	A student of the game, he was

	Seventeen months on the road

	When he decided to come back to Tulsa
And give himself up
[Verse 2]

	He walked right into the courthouse

	And told them he wanted to restore
His citizenship
James Rainey Williams
Would have to go to the pen
[Verse 3]

	He went back to the slammer
That time for five years flat
And every time he went to trial
It cost the state a gallon of gas
And a carfare
[Verse 4]

	James' wife she wrote him
And told him that she loved him so
So James wrote back and told her
About the flat top mountain high
And the pretty women layin' in the wheat
[Verse 5]

	Well, Oklahoma City ain't
More than a half a mile
From Tulsa, that’s up in Indian country
Rainey went there to hunt some company
He was lookin' for some Tulsa women
That he wanted to treat him true
[Verse 6]

	He walked out on the street one night

	See an officer that he knew
Seventeen months, they tried to catch him

	Now they were going to nail him down
So he said "How do, Mr. Officer?”
He told the officer he was doing fine
[Verse 7]

	He told him he just changed his name

	And he said he had just come from Tennessee
Told the officer that his name was Jim West
Said he worked for the county
Knew every road in the state
[Verse 8]

	Well, the officer was so bored
He felt like he was in a trance
He just did not care
"Anything you want to do, you’ll
Have to do it with your finger"
"Stick it in the door,” the officer said
[Verse 9]

	Well, that door was locked
From the outside and the officer he
Just moved back about a foot
Rainey took two steps, grabbed his throat
With his right hand, and held him with his left
And kicked the door wide
[Verse 10]

	He broke the officer’s jaw
And he knocked the officer down
He ran across the street to a cafe
Where the waitress was a pretty girl
He said, "You better run and get
A police officer in this town
Or I'm liable to kill one of these men
[Verse 11]

	You better get me an officer
Right now, or somebody’s going to get killed
This is an emergency"
He said, "If you really want
To get an officer, go down the street
And call one out from the jail
[Verse 12]

	The next day James Rainey Williams
Tied the record seven times
That he had broke out of the Tulsa jail
And James Rainey Williams
Soon became a legend in his own time
And James Rainey Williams
Was the greatest jail breaker
That ever did roam

[Chorus]
A friend to all is a friend to none
 
	(A friend to all is a friend to none)

	A friend to all is a friend to none

	(A friend to all is a friend to none)

	It takes a wise man to learn to trust

	It takes a wise man to learn to trust

	It takes a wise man to learn to trust

	But it takes a fool to learn to trust

	It takes a fool to learn to trust—well!

[Verse 1]

	I keep looking for an honest man

	I keep looking for an honest man

	I keep looking for an honest man

	I keep looking for an honest man

	Well I’m growing sick of all my trusted friends

	I’m growing sick of all my trusted friends

	I’m growing sick of all my trusted friends

	I’m growing sick of all my trusted friends

Well they’re no good and they’re no help to me

	They’re no good and they’re no help to me

	They’re no good and they’re no help to me

	They’re no good and they’re no help to me

	Oh my!

	[Verse 1]

	When I was with Mary she was so beautiful

	Young girl, you’re so fine, come into my room tonight

	Young girl, you’re so fine, come into my room tonight

	Bring your radio, play it as loud as you like

	I had a dream about the time when I was on drugs

	I was chasin' that Mexican jailbird Jeanie

	Who let me do it for free

	[Chorus]

	To the window, to the wall, 'til the sweat run down my balls

	I need a woman ’bout twice my age

	I need a woman ’bout twice my age

	I need a woman ’bout twice my age

	I need somebody I don’t have to teach

	I was at the carnival playin' the shooting game

	I was at the carnival playin' the shooting game

	I was at the carnival playin' the shooting game

	Then I ran into a little fat girl from Switzerland

	I said, "Do you like candy?”

	She said, "Yes, I do!”

[Verse 1]
George was an honest man
 
	But now he’s gone and past tense

	He was always a well-known man

	Till the day he shot a man in Reno just to watch him die

[Verse 2]

	He gunned him down with no remorse

	Some people say, they say he didn’t know what he did

	All he knew was hammer down, he gunned him down and let him have it
[Verse 3]

	George went up to the county jail

	Asked them his friend, told him that he had no bail

	Then he turned and said, "This is an honor you probably never had,” he said

 "I’m putting you, Jack
Burrows, in charge of all my affairs”
[Verse 4]

	George’s wife, she was a beauty

	All the men think she’s got a beauty face

	She always dressed in the finest style

	But in her heart she’s not so fine
[Verse 5]

	She went to Reno and she fixed the case

	The D.A. too, she’s been taking bribes

	She got Jack off and she paid the judge off

	And she’s been living in George’s affairs9/21/2022, 12:46:49 AM

I'm an old school picker, yeah I like to play the blues
 
	 I got a Gibson gal, she got moonlight in her blues

	 Well, them city lights ain't got no shine, baby, like the glare from

	 that old pickup truck of mine

	 Well, I love that gasoline smell, when she's layin' like a interstate

	 through the North Carolina pines

	 Well, my road's got a mighty tight curve, I'm a-huggin' her with

	 righteous love

	 But I got to watch these women, they are so inclined to blow a good thing right to hell

Hey, hey, hey
[Verse 2]

	Well, there's some good things that money just can't buy and I ain't got

	that much dough

	 But pretty women by the gallon, they got their legs all spread

	 wide

	 Well, I aim my pistol at the sun 'til I hear that heavy metal hum

Til I hear my engine roar

	 Well, I been everywhere and I ain't been nowhere yet and that's about

Tol make me lose my faith
Hey, hey, hey
[Verse 3]

	Well, I'm headin' up to Detroit when this drive is over, I got a situation

	 to see to there

	 BUt I better watch myself, old Satan is a waiting on me to slip up

	 just one more time
Yes! I really better watch myself 'fore I lose my cool, get a hot foot up

	 in his behind
Well, all the good women are at home and the bad women are on the road

Fillin' all the country bars with their dirty songs
Hey, hey, hey
[Verse 4]

	Well, I'm an old school picker and I like to play the blues

	 And I'm not trying to get rich, just trying to get along

	 But life's so hard and love's so rough sometimes it's just like tryin' to cross the Mississippi in a rubber boat
Well, I'm leaning on some secret mixture and I'm packing up my best

Trying to get back home to you
Well, I wish somebody would tell me, yes tell me what's wrong with a woman that's one of a kind
Who's always on your mind and never on your waist
Hey, hey, hey
[Verse 5]

	Well, everything is not what it is, it is what it seems to be

	 or maybe it ain't

	 So let me be with my woman tonight and keep my dreams off of this dirty street

	 That's full of mean disgrace
Well, I thought that money could buy me love but I found out just the other day

	 That money don't mean a thing if ya got no one to love
I'd trade all of my life just for a sweet goodbye
From a fairwell blues
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]

I'm happy to say
I got that old time religion
Pouring down like honey
I'm an old school picker
Yeah, I like to play the blues
And I go where my heart wants me to
I'm happy to say
I got that old time religion
Pouring down like honey
I've been dusted and I've been blinded
I've been to the county fair
Nothin' satisfies me
But that old time religion
Pouring down like honey
[Verse 2]
I've been dusted and I've been blinded
I've been to the county fair
Nothin' satisfies me
But that old time religion
Pouring down like honey
I seen men healed of the blind
I seen men healed of the lame
Standing in the aisle
Singing about Jerusalem
Because I got that old time religion
Pouring down like honey
[Verse 3]
I seen men healed of the blind
I seen men healed of the lame
Standing in the aisle
Singing about Jerusalem
Yeah, because I got that old time religion
Pouring down like honey
I'm an old school picker
Yeah, I like to play the blues
And I go where my heart wants me to
I'm happy to say
I got that old time religion
Pouring down like honey

[Chorus]
1
 
I go where the sun is shining
And I get what I want when I go to my friends
They're scattered all about
And that's about as far as I been
Well, I got a friend in California
A couple in Milwaukee, too
And I got some more down in Houston
And one or two up in Maine
[Verse 2]
I'm an old school driver
Yeah, I'm an old school man
And I drive a big old Pontiac
I drive it when the sun is high
And I wait for a new day to come
When I want to take a journey
I take to the highway
But sometimes I get there and sometimes I don't
And that's about as far as I've been
I'm an old school thinker
Yeah, I am an old school man
I think of things that never been
I look where the sun never shine
And I see things that never will be
Like the fish in the ocean
And the birds that fly through the trees
And I look to that horizon
Where the sun is always shining out of place
[Verse 4]
Well, I'm an old school crooner
Yeah, I am an old school man
And I sing of things that never been
I sing of. things that never will be
I sing a song when I'm playing my blues
About a ship that's in the clouds
And about a train that's on the ocean
About a road and about a highway
That will take you back to your home
Well, I'm an old school memorizer
Yeah, I am an old school man
And when I look at memories
I think about all of those friends I've known
I think of the ones that left me
And the ones that never will be seen again
[Verse 5]
I'm an old school falcon
Yeah, I'm an old school man
And I fly high over the skies of life
I fly over them where they dies
And I feed on the carrion of time
Well, I'm an old school driver
Yeah, I'm an old school man
And I drive all night when it's raining hard
And I'm thinking back on yesterday
About that gal that's so far away
About the time when we didn't have to try
About a friend who one time gave me a ride
In his big old Pontiac
Well, I'm an old school drummer
Yes, I'm an old school man
I beat on things that don't make a sound
But I hear things that never will be said
Come along, pretty baby, with me
Go down, Lorelei Lee, so well
Every day is a winding road, it meanders all about
[Verse 7]
Well, I'm an old school politician
Yeah, I am an old school man
But I can scheme and connive with the best of them
I play the role that you've assigned to me
But the truth never left my lips
I guess it never will be said
That I didn't do it my way
So come along, pretty baby, with me
Come along, Lorelei Lee, so well
Let's go riding in my big old Pontiac
Let's drive all night through the pouring rain
[Verse 8]
Well, I'm an old school trembler
Yeah, I'm an old school man
And from time to time I tremble withered and weak
I can change when everything is wrong
But sometimes a man must be strong
I'm an old school lover
Yeah, I'm an old school man
And when you're with me darling it's so plain to see
That you're mine alone forever
That you never have to be free again
So come along, pretty baby, with me
Drive all night through the pouring rain
Let's ride in my big old Pontiac
Let's go riding down that long and winding road again
[Verse 9]
Well, there's a gal in a red dress drinking beer out on the lawn
She's laughing with the other girls and they're having a ball
She's looking straight at me but she doesn't see me at all
And that's about as far as I can see
Well, I'm an old school picker
Yes, I'm an old school man
And I pick the strings just like a ringing a bell
But sometimes you can pick the strings too hard
Sometimes you can make that mother moan
So come along, pretty baby, with me
Let's ride in my big old Pontiac
Let's go driving all night through the pouring rain
[Verse 10]
Well, tomorrow is the last day of all of our loving here today
The last time we'll be riding in that car away from here all alone
I got something on my mind and it won't go away
I'll lay in the bed tonight and turn out all the lights so I can see
There's an old friend coming over and he's bringing some wine and beer
So come along, pretty baby, with me
Drive all night through the pouring rain…
Button up that wino wine and beer
Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... Well, we drove all night long
Through the pouring rain... Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... Yeah, we're riding all night long... Through the pouring rain... Let's ride down that long and winding road again... Yeah.. We're riding all night long... Through the pouring rain... Let's ride in that big old Pontiac... Yeah... Driving through the pouring rain... Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... We're going riding all night long... All night long... Through the pouring rain... We're going riding down that long and winding road again... We're riding all night long... Through the pouring rain... We're going driving all night long... All night long... Through the pouring rain... Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... Let's drive all night long... Through the pouring rain... We're going riding in my big old Pontiac... Yeah... We're going riding all night long... Through that pouring rain... All night long... Through the pouring rain... All night long... Through the pouring rain... Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... Yeah... Drive all night long... All night long... Through the pouring rain.. Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... Yeah... Drive all night long... All night long... Through the pouring rain... Let's ride in my big old Pontiac... Let's go riding in my big old Pontiac... Let's drive all night long... Through the pouring rain... You see, we didn't have no cell phones, no texts, no emails, no computers. We had to do it old school! And the only reason we were able to get this done was because some very good friends were willing to help us out. So without them, it would not have happened. So thank you so much for working with us. The last thing we did was bring it up to Bob's recording studio. And once again it was Roy Blakey and Barry Beckett doing the engineering. I think 


9/21/2022, 7:35:32 PM 
[Verse 1]
She told me
we had enough time 
 to make it
And I believed her
but sometimes I hear other voices
That rattle around in my head
Saying that there ain't
She ain't got no good time left
And I believe them
[Verse 2]
She told me
we had enough money to last
But I guess she don't know
I'm always spending more money
Than I got
And I guess she don't know
That I'm going to pieces on the shelf
Can't you see that I'm coming apart at the seams?
And I believe them
[Verse 3]
They told me
if I took their advice
I'd never have cause to worry
I'm believing them
but I don't know what to do
There's a hole in the pit of my stomach
And it's driving me to you
Don't you know I'm coming apart at the seams?
But I believe them
[Verse 4]
I dreamed about you last night
But you kept on changing every time you turned around
You changed into someone new again
I felt like I was going crazy to hear you crying there in the next room
I was trying so hard to do the right thing and make it through
Can't you see that I'm coming apart at the seams?
But I believe them
I believe them
[Verse 5]
You told me I should quit crying
That trying to hold something that don't want to be held was only making me blind
But if I let go now I'll be losing the best thing I ever did find
But I'm afraid that I'm coming apart at the seams
And I believe them
I believe them
But I believe them 


9/21/2022, 7:41:08 PM 
[Verse 1]
You told me I should quit crying
That trying to hold something that don't want to be held was only making me blind
But if I let go now I'll be losing the best thing I ever did find
But I'm afraid that I'm coming apart at the seams 

And I can barely keep breathing and my heart it fears
That I can't keep going on this way
[Verse 2]
You told me to forget her
If she let me down, then I was supposed to let her go and forget that she was ever mine
But I, I'm afraid that I'm coming apart at the seams
And I can barely keep breathing, and my heart it fears
That I can't keep going on this way
[Bridge]
Yes, and I'm grinning and bearing her lipstick traces
And I'm hiding her lingerie
And I laugh when her friends call
And I'm driving her car
But at night in the dark
When I'm all alone
I wonder whom she's turning to
[Verse 3]
You told me to get plenty of rest
And stop running around like a chicken with its head cut off
But I, I'm afraid that I'm coming apart at the seams
And I can barely keep breathing and my heart it fears
That I can't keep going on this way
[Verse 3]
You told me to save all my time and money
Come down to Little Rock sometime and meet you
But I, I'm afraid that I'm coming apart at the seams
And I can barely keep breathing, and my heart it fears
That I can't keep going on this way

He was an old school picker
he liked to play the blues 

He was an old school picker
he liked to play the blues
He spent all his lifetime
picking cotton for the
white man’s good luck
[Verse 1]
He’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone on home
He’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone on home
The last thing he said
was "Please don’t bury me
down below the Mason-Dixon line”

Well, the last time I seen him
was down in Tulane
Well, the last time I seen him
was down in Tulane
He was wearing some old high-top sneakers
wearing some high-top sneakers
but they could not hide that yellow blood
[Chorus]
He was an old school picker

He was an old school picker

He always said what he means
There was nobody could sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

And the women they all flocked around him
like seagulls to the sea, yeah

[Verse 1]
He was a man of few words
but he could play the guitar
And he'd pick all night long
if you wanted him to

[Bridge]
And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 3]
He wore his sun-bleached hair
piled high upon his head
He was never afraid
to go out and do just what he said

[Verse 2]
Well, he never stayed too long 

in any one town
And he wrote his songs
about the places he'd been
And he played 'em for a while
then he'd hum 'em and he'd sing 'em
And then he'd move along
He could play the guitar
Like no man you've heard
But he never looked at anyone
but the' lady he loved so dear
And he always played inA bar
where a neon light would shine
On the steel strings of a guitar
that was built for two
[Outro]
Oh, he was a man of few words
but he could play the guitar
And he'd play it all night long
if you wanted him to
Ah, he'd pick out songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around for a long, long time
He'd been around for a long, long time
He'd been around for a long, long time

but he could play the guitar
And he'd pick all night long
if you wanted him to

[Bridge]
And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 2]
Well, 
 he lived by himself
in a one-room country shack
With an old guitar
and an old dog on the porch
[Bridge]
He loved to sing about
the girls he used to know
And he'd been around
for a long, long time
[Verse 3]
Well, the local girls
all knew where he was at
And they'd show up at his door
every now and then
[Bridge]
But he never took
their love too serious
'Cause he'd been around
for a long, long time
[Verse 4]
Well, the sheriff came
one day to his door
Said, "Your rent is two weeks late, boy
You better get it soon"
[Bridge]
He said, "Oh, no, no, no, Sheriff
I got no money to pay
I've been around for a long, long time"
[Verse 5]
Well, the sheriff took
his old guitar away
And he said, "Now I've got no reason to stay
'Cause my life has gone to waste away"
[Bridge]
Now he's walking 'long the highway
With his old guitar in his hand
And he's been around for a long, long time
[Verse 6]
Well, he walked all day long
and he walked all night long
But he never could seem to find the right spot to go
[Bridge]
So he walked back to town again
With his old guitar in his hand
And he's been around for a long, long time
[Verse 7]
Well, he walked all day long
and he walked all night long
But he never could seem to find the right spot to go
[Bridge]
So he walked back to town again
With his old guitar in his hand
And he's been around for a long, long time
[Verse 8]
Well, he walked all day long
and he walked all night long
But he never could seem to find the right spot to go
[Bridge]
So he walked back to town again
With his old guitar in his hand
And he's been around for a long, long time
[Verse 9]
Well, I picked him up hitchhiking one day on Highway 61 outside of Savannah, Georgia, and we traveled all night long and into the next day till we got to Memphis about an hour before dark and I let him out on Beale Street and I watched him walk away and then I headed back home to the north and I never saw that guy again in my life and I hope wherever he is now, that he's doing well. God bless him wherever he may be. And that's it. Thank you. Good night. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Good night. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Goodnight. Goodnight.

[Verse 1]
He was a man of few words
but he could play the guitar
And he'd pick all night long
if you wanted him to

[Bridge]
And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 2]
Well, 
 he wore a smile
from ear to ear
And he loved to sing
as much as he loved to play
And he'd been around
for a long, long time
[Bridge]
And he'd play at parties
for his friends and neighbors too
And he'd play for a dance
if you called him for a two-step too
[Verse 3]
He was rangy and tall
with dark and curly hair
And he'd been around
for a long, long time
[Bridge]
Well, he'd picked for the king
of the Delta Blues
And he'd picked for the queen of country-western too
[Verse 4]
But he never would play nothing that he didn't like
He said, "I'll play the music, you just pay me my dime"
And he'd been around
for a long, long time
[Bridge]
Well, he played at country fairs
and at picnics too
And at a prison once
for some bad news too
[Verse 5]
He played at the house of the rising sun one night
For some people who could really play the guitar pretty right
But he never would show off, never would say a word
Just wink his eye and say "Howdee do?" when he come around
And he'd been around for a long, long time
[Bridge]
Well, he wore no shoeshine, no fancy clothes to wear
Just an old pair of jeans and an old cotton shirt to wear
And whenever he would play his guitar you could really hear it ring
For he was one of the greatest pickers ever picked a string!
[Verse 6]
So if you ever see him walking down the road some day
Give him a little smile and say "How do you do?" that way
For he was a man of few words but he could play his heart out with his hands
And he'd been around for a long, long time!
[Outro]
He was a man of few words but he could play the guitar! Yeah! And he'd been around for a long, long time! Yeah! He was one of the greatest pickers ever picked a string! Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Hee-hee!

And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 1]
Well, he wore a smile
from ear to ear 

But he never was much of a talker
And he wore out a lot of shoes
on the hard road
Well, he had a heart
as big as Texas
He was just passing through
but he liked it a lot

Well, his songs were sad, about love and loss and change
And some of them sounded pretty strange if you listened in and listened close at hand
But if you wanted to dance and you didn't give a hang
You just let them ring on and on and on and on and on…you see?

You can always tell when Bob is having fun singing. That was one of them. There was nothing like that in the shows at the beginning of the tour. But there were two shows left before Tokyo and it was evident to everyone that Bob had reached some sort of comfort zone. He'd played well in Hamburg and he'd reached some level of comfort in Berlin. He just seemed happy to be here with us. Sometimes you get that feeling: "Oh boy, what am I doing here? I'm in Germany!" But tonight he got over any inhibitions about being outside America and seemed glad to be on the road with us. It was also evident

and the local girls
all knew where he was at
And they'd show up at his door
yeah, all the girls gathered round when 
they heard his tune
and they always wanted more
but he never took their love too seriously, 
'cause he'd been around 
for a long, long time
[Verse 5]
He was a man of few words but 
he could play the guitar and 	he'd pick all night long if you wanted him to and 	he'd strum his songs to the rising sun and 	he'd been around for a long, long time 	[Verse 6] 	He was a man of simple tastes and his clothes were torn but 	he always helped the poor and the local girls all knew where he was at and 	they'd show up at his door yeah, all the girls gathered round when they heard his tune and they always wanted more but he never took their love too seriously 'cause he'd been around for a long, long time 	[Verse 7] He was a man of few words but he could play the guitar and he'd pick all night long if you wanted him to and he'd strum his songs to the rising sun and he'd been around for a long, long time 	[Verse 8] He was a man of simple tastes and his clothes were torn but he always helped the poor and the local girls all knew where he was at and they'd show up at his door yeah, all the girls gathered round when they heard his tune and they always wanted more but he never took their love too seriously 'cause he'd been around for a long, long time 	[Outro] He was a man of few words but he could play the guitar and pick all night long if you wanted him to and strum his songs to the rising sun and been around for a long, long time.

 [Chorus]
He was a man of few words
but he could play the guitar
And he'd pick all night long
if you wanted him to
And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 1]
he'd skip from town to town for fun
but he'd never stay too long
to the people he felt familiar
grew accustomed to his song
and when he'd pack his things and go
they'd always be confused
Cause somehow or another,
they always thought
that he'd been around, 
for a long, long time

[Verse 2]
He was a man of simple tastes
and his clothes were torn
but he always helped the poor
and the local girls
all knew where he was at
And they'd show up at his door
yeah, all the girls gathered round when 
they heard his tune
and they always wanted more
but he never took their love too seriously,
'cause he'd been around 
for a long, long time

[chorus]

[Verse 3]
He was rangy and tall
with dark and curly hair 

Well, he could make all the women
feel all right, I swear
He'd keep them goin' several times
in a one-night stand
He was strictly no-good
though he didn't mean no harm
the whole world knew all about
this man or years and years, they trusted his feelin'
they'd often say, "This guy has been 
around for a long long time")
[Verse 4]
He was 99 and 44⁄100 per cent pure sand I swear he had a natural instinct to find the better part of every woman that made him do some things... you wouldn't do but it was okay 'cause he played a much better guitar and he sang much better songs in your life you've seen some men that could play, who could work it on the single string and go into harmonic zones and make their fingertips do things that other people couldn't do well let me say this man could play with anybody else on any level and those who played with him said his playing was trueand everything about him was so fine yeah and all the local girls would say when the girls gathered round, "We know where this guy's gonna be at and we know what he's feelin' like tonight. He never left us before. He must have been around for a long long time''
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Well they buried him beneath his waving flag somewhere back in 'Nam when he died in '69 but those Yankees who like to dig them up replaced his body from his resting spot one mornin' in 79 when they were opening up the parkin' lot! He's still bleeding, but I don't care!

 [Chorus]
He was a man of few words
but he could pick the guitar
And he'd play all night long
if you wanted him to
And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 1]
he'd skip from town to town for fun
but he'd never stay too long
to the people he felt familiar
they grew accustomed to his song
and when he'd pack his things and go
they were puzzled an confused
Cause somehow or another,
they always thought
that he'd stick around, 
for a long, long time

[Verse 2]
He was a man of simple tastes
and his clothes were torn
but he always helped the poor
and the local girls
all knew where he was at
And they'd show up at his door

and they always wanted more
but he never took their love too seriously,
'cause he'd been around 
for a long, long time

[chorus]

[Verse 3]
He was rangy and tall
with dark and curly hair
And a twinkle in his eyes 

that never seemed to stray
he loved his guitar
like a little child does
and he'd play hеr till the sunrise
and he'd sleep all nighlong away, hоwever
every young girl wanted him so much,
they thought he'd surely stay
Though he was a man of few words
he had something to say
but when the sun went down
he'd excuse himself with a "Oh, I guess it's time for me to go home."
And the girls, they all sighed 'cause they knew what he meant, 
when he politely removed himself from their love embrace, 〰though they still hoped that he'd stop back again
Cause they knew where he was at!
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
He had many friends all around, if you want to know who they are and where they are at, check the graveyard where their bodies lay upon the sod. They always tell me: "Become a friend of Jack's and you will always win". But I can't become no friend of his! Lord have mercy! Ah! I'm already in! Cause I have seen this man with my own eyes do so many things that no other man could do And though you may know about his name wherever he go's And however far his journey's taken him from home Though deep within your heart you're sure that you are sure That someday someway somehow gonna see this man again You can only ask yourself: "How much tarpaper did your loved ones' remains require?"[Chorus]

[chorus]

[Verse 3]
He was rangy and tall
with dark and curly hair
And a twinkle in his eyes 

like the stars up in the skies
He could steal your heart away
and you'd begin to pray
that he'd divide his time
and be here today and gone tomorrow,
but he was a man who had patience,
he was kind and considerate, 
'Cause he knew that each year one lives, one learns another
deep, surprising truth
And half the fun of loving 
is loving the one you're with, for a long, long time

 [Verse 1]
I still have the t-shirt I bought you
never found the right time to give it away
you may not ever see it, but
I think you would've liked it anyway
 
It's hard to believe I've known you
for twenty-one years
all that time and you're still my best friend
I just go where you lead
[Chorus]
We keep drivin' through the night
looking for something we might have missed
keep going' down that road till break of dawn
we're keepin' on going north of reason
we keep driving through the night, my darling

I heard about you in a

I still have the t-shirt I bought you
never found the right time to give it away
you may not ever see it, but
I think you would've liked it anyway
 
Planning to drive in t'roo the deep blue sea
I don't want to beat it 'round the mountain to see you
I'm gonna take that ride, gonna kiss my bride
You may not ever know it but I'm going to be alright
[Verse 2]
Don't know when I'm comin' back again
You wouldn't like me if I didn't go again
I miss ya honey, but ya taught me t' fly myself
Away from everywhere, into somewhere new
My heart's a-searching for the things unheard of
I feel the day is breaking and I must be on my way
You may not ever see it, but I'm going to be alright
[Verse 3]
Sometimes the sun comes up and sometimes it don't
You've got to keep your head up and play it by your heart
My music sounds when I come back t'you honey
I play too rough and carry on a little too far sometimes
Let everything slide out of my hand, oh when I want you so bad
Well, honey I can tell you're slipping away from me anyway
