{"prompt":"","completion":"[Verse 1]\nThe festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\nHe was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 2]\nHe moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\n“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\nJID “Dance Now' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified[Verse 3]\nBackstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs\nLily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair\nOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide\nA gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 4]\nBig Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine\nHe made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 5]\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\nShe slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\n“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear\nHe was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 6]\n“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself\n“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\nStaring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\n [Verse 7]\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\nShe had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 8]\nThe hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\nThe drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\nNo, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 9]\nRosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\nWas looking to do just one good deed before she died\nShe was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 10]\nLily took her dress off, buried it away\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\nHave known it would someday\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”\nDown the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts\n [Verse 11]\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\nHe went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 12]\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked\nAnd Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 13]\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\nFor one more member who had business back in town\nBut they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 14]\nThe next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink\nThe hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink\nThe only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts\n[Verse 15]\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\nShe was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\nThinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law\nBut most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts"}{"prompt":"","completion":"[Verse 1]\nThe festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall\nThe curfew had been lifted
