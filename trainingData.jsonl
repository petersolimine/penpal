{"prompt":"","completion":"[Intro]\nI have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called \"Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie\"\n[Verse 1]\nWhen yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\nWhen you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\nWhen yer laggin' behind an' losing yer pace\nIn a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin' up\nIf the wine don't come to the top of yer cup\nIf the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\nAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long\nAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\nAnd tomorrow's morning seems so far away\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'\nAnd the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'\nAnd the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'\nAnd yer whole world's a-slamming and banging\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way\nWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born\"\nAnd you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat\nAnd you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\nAnd the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stare\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're frying\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street\nAnd yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt\nOr yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\nWhen you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flush\nAnd all the time you were holdin' three queens\nAnd it's making you mad, it's makin' you mean\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\nBouncin' around a pinball machine\nAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'\nBut it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\nAnd it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed\nAnd no matter how you try you just can't say it\nAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\nAnd his jaws start closing with you underneath\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doing\nOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'\nOn this curve I'm hanging\nOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking\nIn this air I'm inhaling\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\nWhat am I saying, what am I knowing\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'\nOn this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'\nIn the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'\nIn the words that I'm thinking\nIn this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\nBut you try with your whole soul best\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\nOr make yer heart pound\nBut then again you know when they're around\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\n'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'\nAnd you can't remember for the best of yer thinking\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\nAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'\nAnd you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\nAnd you need something special\nYeah, you need something special all right\nYou need a fast flying train on a tornado track\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\nThat's been banging and booming and blowing forever\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race\nThat won't laugh at yer looks\nYour voice or your face\nAnd by any number of bets in the book\nWill be rolling long after the bubblegum craze\nYou need something to open up a new door\nTo show you something you seen before\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\nYou need something to open your eyes\nYou need something to make it known\nThat it's you and no one else that owns\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting\nThat the world ain't got you beat\nThat it ain't got you licked\nIt can't get you crazy no matter how many\nTimes you might get kicked\nYou need something special all right\nYou need something special to give you hope\nBut hope's just a word\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard\nOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve\n[Bridge]\nBut that's what you need man, and you need it bad\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\n'Cause you look an' you start getting the chills\n[Verse 2]\n'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill\nAnd it ain't on Macy's window sill\nAnd it ain't on no rich kid's road map\nAnd it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house\nAnd it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ\nAnd it ain't on that dimlit stage\nWith that half-wit comedian on it\nRanting and raving and taking yer money\nAnd you think it's funny\nNo you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club\nAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper club\nAnd sure as hell you're bound to tell\nThat no matter how hard you rub\nYou just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub\nNo, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you\nAnd it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you\nAnd it ain't in no cardboard-box house\nOr down any movie star's blouse\nAnd you can't find it on the golf course\nAnd Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus\nAnd it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes\nAnd it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons\nAnd it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices\nThat come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'\nSayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin\nLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glow\nLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry\nWhen you can't even sense if they got any insides\nThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bows\nNo you'll not now or no other day\nFind it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache\nAnd inside it the people made of molasses\nThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses\nAnd it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies\nWho'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack\nAnd before you can count from one to ten\nDo it all over again but this time behind yer back\nMy friend\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world\nAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\nThat run around gallant\nAnd make all rules for the ones that got talent\nAnd it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do\nAnd think they're foolin' you\nThe ones who jump on the wagon\nJust for a while cause they know it's in style\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat\nSayin', \"Christ do I gotta be like that\nAin't there no one here that knows where I'm at\nAin't there no one here that knows how I feel\nGood God Almighty\nTHAT STUFF AIN'T REAL\"\nNo but that ain't yer game, it ain't yer race\nYou can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face\nYou gotta look some other place\nAnd where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'\nWhere do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'\nWhere do you look for this oil well gushin'\nWhere do you look for this candle that's glowin'\nWhere do you look for this hope that you know is there\nAnd out there somewhere\nAnd your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads\nYour eyes can only look through two kinds of windows\nYour nose can only smell two kinds of hallways\nYou can touch and twist\nAnd turn two kinds of doorknobs\nYou can either go to the church of your choice\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\nYou'll find God in the church of your choice\nYou'll find Woody Guthrie in
