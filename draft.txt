[Verse 1]
He was a man of few words
but he could play the guitar
And he'd pick all night long
if you wanted him to

[Bridge]
And he'd strum his songs
to the rising sun
And he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 2]
Well, he lived by himself
in a one-room shack
With an old guitar


[Verse 3]
Well, the local girls
all knew where he was at
And they'd show up at his door
every now and then

[Bridge]
But he never took
their love too serious
'Cause he'd been around
for a long, long time

[Verse 3]
He was rangy and tall
with dark and curly hair
And he'd been around
for a long, long time


Well, I picked him up hitchhiking
one day on Highway 61
outside of Savannah, Georgia,
and we traveled all night long and
into the next day till we got to Memphis 
about an hour before dark 
and I let him out on Beale Street 
and I watched him walk away
and then I headed back home to
the north and I never saw
that guy again in my life and I hope 
wherever he is now,
that he's doing well.
God bless him wherever he may be.
And that's it.
Thank you. Good night. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Good night. Goodbye.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Goodnight. Goodnight.
