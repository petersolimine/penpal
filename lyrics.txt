[Verse 1]
The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left townHe was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 2]
He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts[Verse 3]
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud
 by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pairOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 4]
Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts[Verse 5]
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into townShe slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 6]
“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself
“Maybe down in Mexico
 or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 7]
Lily was a princess
, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 8]
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind

It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 9]
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts


[Verse 10]
Lily took her dress off, buried it away
“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday

Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts
