Scrape lyrics and fine tune a GPT-3 model to write songs

The idea here is to get songs from Genius and train a model with empty prompts where the completions are songs you like.

Doesn't make sense? No problem...

All you'll need to do (eventually) is a custom list of Genius.com song IDs, an OpenAI Secret Key, NPM, and Python.

Update: genius has an API so no need to scrape lols
