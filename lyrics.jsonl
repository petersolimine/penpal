[Verse 1]
Remember we were ridin' in your car
Not thinking ’bout much, didn't get too far
Nineteen miles till the gas ran out
And I ain't ever walk that far before
Tastes like candy and cigarettes
And at that point, I hadn’t tasted anything better yet
Got that love that can make a man
Got those eyes that make a man forget
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh oh


[Chorus]
Say you love me all the way
Say that you love me too
Say that you'll call every me single day
Place a phone call for you
And I'll let you listen to my favorite tapes
Play my tapes right through
Say that you love me all the way
Hey, aye, hey, aye, hey, aye aye

[Verse 3]
She said, "I'll try to help you if I can
After all this time, you're still the man
But we're just books upon a shelf
Try to understand this if you can."
Then she giggles like a bubble bath
Oh I love it when you laugh
Rang like pennies in a tin can
There's only one question left to ask
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh oh

[Chorus]
Do you love me all the way
Say that you love me too
Say that you'll call every single day
Place a phone call for you
And I’ll let you listen to my favorite tapes
Play my tapes right through
Say that you love me all the way


[Chorus]
Say that you love me all the way
Say that you love me too
Say that you’ll call every single day
Place a phone call for you
And I'll let you listen to my favorite tapes
Play my tapes right through
Say that you love me all the way
Hey, aye, hey, aye, hey, aye aye
